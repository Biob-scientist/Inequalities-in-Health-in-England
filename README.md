## Overview
***
>Health inequalities are disparities in health status or the allocation of health resources across various population groups that result from the socioeconomic circumstances under which
individuals are born, develop, live, work, and age. Health imbalances are unjust and can be remedied with the correct combination of government interventions. This analysis treats trivial questions relating to health imbalance in all the cities in England with
reference to the life expectancy at birth. 

## Dataset
***
>The dataset was provided by the employer and it contained life expectancy data for males and females in 326 unique cities in England. The dataset given could be downloaded [here](https://wpieconomics.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=5331abc1c0dacc833dd4e807b&id=645de758bb&e=9f29c59835.csv). 

## Preliminary Data Wrangling
***
>Upon data asssessment, the data fell short of quality and tidiness issues. This was addressed one after the other starting with the quality issues. The latter part of the data cleaning process tidied up the table by creating a gender column and rendering the life expectancy to a single column.

## Summary of Findings
***
> The result of the exploratory analysis is largely intuitive. However, it also yields a striking outcome that deviates from the norm.

> It was gathered from the analysis that there is a difference between male (mean=79.6 years)and female(mean=83.5 years) life expectancy.
